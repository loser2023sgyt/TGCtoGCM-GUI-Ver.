# TGCtoGCM GUI Version.
This is a GUI version of the old 2000s tool named TGCtoGCM.

.TGC is a proprietary file format created by Nintendo themselves, which is commonly found on GameCube demo discs. It is the only official "shrunken" ISO/GCM format from Nintendo. 


Nerdy info:
TGC is basically the same as GCM, except shrunken in size from 1.4 Gigabytes to merely a hundred/three-hundred or so Megabytes. It also parses metadata differently.
Unlike the original program created by Plootid 2004, this is written in C#, not C++.
